# Questions

Here we have 3 questions related to the code base for you to answer. It is not about right or wrong, but more about what's the reasoning behind your decisions.

1. In this code base, we have some different implementation strategies when it comes to database access layer and manipulation. If you would maintain this code base, would you refactor any of those? Why?

**Answer:**
```

I would refactor the Store and Product resources to use Repository pattern for better testability and separation of concerns

2. When it comes to API spec and endpoints handlers, we have an Open API yaml file for the `Warehouse` API from which we generate code, but for the other endpoints - `Product` and `Store` - we just coded directly everything. What would be your thoughts about what are the pros and cons of each approach and what would be your choice?

**Answer:**

I would choose the OpenAPI approach for a professional project. It ensures that the API contract is the "source of truth and helps in integration with frontend or other services much smoother.

```

3. Given the need to balance thorough testing with time and resource constraints, how would you prioritize and implement tests for this project? Which types of tests would you focus on, and how would you ensure test coverage remains effective over time?

**Answer:**
```txt
I would focus on testing business use cases first and then would further drill down to test the integration and different error code validations
